# smith_normal_form
Computes the smith normal form of an integer matrix in C++.

See main.cpp first, where you can input the matrix A (whose Smith Normal Form you with to compute) and see more instructions and descriptions. For this program to work, all files must be put together in a "project" (I used the IDE CodeBlocks) and run.

TO DO: Create pdf file with examples.
